    "The most common way to visualize categorical data is with a bar chart. Another option is pie chart. But pie chart is not really recommended to use since there will be an overlapping label in it and also a similar portion of a circle. In categorical data, it is best to use frequency tables for numerical summaries and bar chart to visualization."
